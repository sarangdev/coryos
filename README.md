# coryos
A completely fresh "operating system", implemented according to all the principles of the modern Web.

# How will it work?
- Lower level
At the bottom, good old Linux is running. In the future, there are plans to develop your own lower level.

- Upper level
At the top level, we are met by Core, API, coryvm and mai tai.

-- Core
It implements communication with the equipment and connects all the components of the system described earlier.

-- API
A magic thing that allows applications to interact with the system, and in principle-to work.

-- coryVM
And this is more interesting...
This is a "software package" that allows you to run applications of familiar platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) directly in coryos. A miracle of technology!

-- aitUI
Multifunctional, beautiful, flexible, and most importantly - fast UI for coryOS.
